## TODOs

- [ ] Tune HP for all models for Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan
- [ ] Use new set of HP to retrain the challenger models (low and medium hii)
- [ ] Retrain benchmark models. Important to use the same preprocessing as used during HPT!
- [ ] Train challenger on similar basins
- [ ] Fine tune and prepare plots
- [ ] Make scaling laws plot. Reflect on what makes sense: one plot where Y axis the the aggregated metric over the 10 days?
- [ ] Choose a journal for Publication
