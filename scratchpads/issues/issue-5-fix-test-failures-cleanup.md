# Issue 5: Fix Remaining Test Failures and Project Cleanup

## Objective
After resolving import issues, fix any remaining test failures and perform general project cleanup.

## Current Status
- Import issues resolved (#1)
- Auto-fixes applied (#2)
- Manual linting completed (#3)
- Type checking fixed (#4)

## Plan

### 1. Fix Remaining Test Failures
- [ ] Run full test suite to identify failures
- [ ] Analyze each failure and implement fixes
- [ ] Ensure proper test coverage

### 2. Code Simplification (Low-priority linting)
- [ ] SIM108: Convert if-else blocks to ternary operators (11 instances)
- [ ] UP038: Use modern union syntax for isinstance (5 instances)
- [ ] B007: Fix unused loop control variables (17 instances)

### 3. Project Cleanup
- [ ] Remove .ipynb_checkpoints/ directories
- [ ] Clean up __pycache__/ directories
- [ ] Remove temporary/experimental files
- [ ] Verify project structure

### 4. CI/CD Verification
- [ ] Run full development pipeline locally
- [ ] Ensure all checks pass
- [ ] Verify ready for GitHub Actions

## Notes
- This is the final cleanup phase
- Focus on production readiness
- Maintain code quality while simplifying
